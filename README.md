 # React Native SDK Install
 ## macOS (<em>ARM</em>)

### Install Homebrew
Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies the installation of various tools and libraries. Please use following commands for installing it.
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Xcode, Ruby, and CocoaPods.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

### Node & Watchman[](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=macos&platform=ios#node--watchman "Direct link to Node & Watchman")

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```shell
brew install node@18 # Node.js 18 LTS
brew install node@20 # Node.js 20 LTS
brew install watchman
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 18.18 or newer.

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

### React Native CLI
Add react native cli using the following command!
```shell
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

### Xcode[](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=macos&platform=ios#xcode "Direct link to Xcode")

Please use the **latest version** of Xcode.

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

#### Command Line Tools[](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=macos&platform=ios#command-line-tools "Direct link to Command Line Tools")
You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. You have two options to install the command line tools,
##### 1. Through Xcode
Open Xcode, then choose **Settings... (or Preferences...)** from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

##### 2. Through Terminal
After Xcode is installed:
```shell
xcode-select --install
```
A pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm the installation. Click `Install`.

#### Verify Installation
To ensure the command line tools are installed correctly, run the following command in Terminal:
```shell
xcode-select -p
```
If the installation was successful, the output will show the path to the command line tools, such as `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.


#### Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode[](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=macos&platform=ios#installing-an-ios-simulator-in-xcode "Direct link to Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode")

To install a simulator, open **Xcode > Settings... (or Preferences...)** and select the **Platforms (or Components)** tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

If you are using Xcode version 14.0 or greater than to install a simulator, open **Xcode > Settings > Platforms** tab, then click "+" icon and select **iOSâ€¦** option.

### Install Ruby
Using Ruby version `3.3.5` is necessary to ensure compatibility with CocoaPods, which is essential for managing dependencies in React Native projects.
```shell
# Ensures compatibility with CocoaPods.
brew install ruby
```

### Install CocoaPods[](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=macos&platform=ios#cocoapods "Direct link to CocoaPods")
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is one of the dependency management system available for iOS. CocoaPods is a Ruby [gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems). You can install CocoaPods using the version of Ruby that ships with the latest version of macOS.

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). Install CocoaPods using Homebrew:
```shell
brew install cocoapods
```


Starting from React Native version 0.69, it is possible to configure the Xcode environment using the `.xcode.env` file provided by the template.

The `.xcode.env` file contains an environment variable to export the path to the `node` executable in the `NODE_BINARY` variable. This is the **suggested approach** to decouple the build infrastructure from the system version of `node`. You should customize this variable with your own path or your own `node` version manager, if it differs from the default.

On top of this, it's possible to add any other environment variable and to source the `.xcode.env` file in your build script phases. If you need to run script that requires some specific environment, this is the **suggested approach**: it allows to decouple the build phases from a specific environment.

info

If you are already using [NVM](https://nvm.sh/) (a command which helps you install and switch between versions of Node.js) and [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), you might want to move the code that initialize NVM from your `~/.zshrc` into a `~/.zshenv` file to help Xcode find your Node executable:

```shell
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] &amp;&amp; \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
```

You might also want to ensure that all "shell script build phase" of your Xcode project, is using `/bin/zsh` as its shell.

### Java JDK
#### Download Zulu JDK installer
Go to the **[Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk#zulu)** download page,
- Java Version: `Java 17 (LTS)` and Java `21 (LTS)` (you'll download each separately)

#### Verify Installations
```shell
java -version
```

### Sets The Variable Permanently 
For your user account, open your shell configuration file (`.zshrc` for `Zsh` or `.bash_profile` for `Bash`) using a text editor:
```shell
nano ~/.zshrc  # or nano ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Example of setting environment variablesExample set the environments
```shell
# Adds Homebrew to the shell environment.
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Enables the OpenSSL legacy provider for Node.js. 
# This is often necessary for compatibility with older dependencies.
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

# Node 14
#export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Node Homebrew
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@16/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/node@16/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/node@16/include"

# Ruby Homebrew
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@2.7/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@2.7/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@2.7/include"

# Java JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home
# export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-20.jdk/Contents/Home
# export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
# export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home
# export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home
```

### That's it!
